# Phaser Game Boilerplate 

Set up for making games in Phaser. Inspired by [Hikari's Station](https://github.com/OmarShehata/hikari-station) which has been my most complete Phaser game.

This little demo shows:

* Basic game setup
* How to create a loading screen
* How to load a spritesheet animation. See [TexturePacker tutorial](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-for-phaser3)

Remaining work:

* Make the game canvas correctly resize and center on the page
* Load and play audio
* Move player with keyboard
* Basic collision 
* Move camera around
