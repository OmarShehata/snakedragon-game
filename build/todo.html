* Make dragon fly slower when key not pressed
* Make clouds NOT get pushed if key is not pressed
* Make clouds that are touching slowly come together
* If more than 5 clouds are touching for more than X seconds, it makes a rain cloud
* A rain cloud will rain after X seconds. Show some rain icon. Then disappear after X seconds
* Leaves a green patch when it's done
* Mark 2-3 farm locations
* Create a game over screen telling you how many patches you made rain. 


* Create cloud pieces that are pushed with collision?
	* Add physics body to each cloud
	* Enable collision, see how that feels
	* Turn off collision, just detect it
		When they are colliding, just make the clouds move away
	* No collision at all, just check when clouds are closeby, and move out of the way


* Discard unused items in list of positions
* if player is out of bounds, turn torwads center


* Connect gamepad twin stick


Done:

* Create dragon head, moving automatically, arrow keys to rotate
* Make dragon have multiple pieces
* Make camera follow both and zoom out
* Explore physics joints for dragon pieces?
