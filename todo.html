game.clouds.forEach(cloud => {cloud.shake = true; }); game.clouds[0].becomeRainCloud();

tile.plot.setTexture('atlas', plotTypes.vegetables);



* If rain cloud close enough to farm tile, make it go to next level. 
* Fade to black when no more clouds (or less than 10 clouds left within bounds?)
* End screen gives you stats

* Rotate the clouds
* Make arrow keys also work for single dragon
* Fix camera jump when you go back to solo mode

* Require minumum number of clouds to make rain cloud?
* Figure out why adding tiles in BG makes fps drop? 
* Discard unused items in list of positions
* if player is out of bounds, turn torwads center
* Connect gamepad twin stick


Done:
* Add farm pieces
* Make rain cloud appear when clouds disappear. For a few seconds, then disappears. 
	* Size depends on number of clouds inside?
* If you "rain dance" near a cloud clump, it becomes rain cloud
* Press space again to go back to single mode
* Press space to split
* Improve cloud dragging (basically move along with the dragon)
* Add cloud icons
* Make solo camera
* Make dragon slower 
* Add dragon bodies in 
* Make clouds NOT get pushed if key is not pressed


* Create dragon head, moving automatically, arrow keys to rotate
* Make dragon have multiple pieces
* Make camera follow both and zoom out
* Explore physics joints for dragon pieces?
	OR see: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/snake


* Make dragon fly slower when key not pressed

* Create cloud pieces that are pushed with collision?
	* Add physics body to each cloud
	* Enable collision, see how that feels
	* Turn off collision, just detect it
		When they are colliding, just make the clouds move away
	* No collision at all, just check when clouds are closeby, and move out of the way
