Soar above the skies as the majestic (and clumsy!) snakedragon and bring rain to the villagers


=====

​Control the weather as the mighty snakedragon & the rain spirit. Will you bring rain to the pious believers? Or be a benevolent God and bring rain to all? Or perhaps be an angry storm dragon and flood all the fields...

Made in 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK Jam.
​​
Controls

    WASD/Arrow keys to move.
    Push clouds by flying fast through them (holding W or UP)
    Space to toggle the rain spirit 

​Game ends when less than 30 clouds remain. Use clouds for rain or push them outside of the village.

To perform a rain dance, both dragons' centers need to be flying very close for at least 3 seconds. Try making them both circle the same spot, or perform a figure-8 shape.

Too much rain will flood the farm.

Background

The theme for this game jam was "Joined Together".  We started out with an idea to join together pieces to create something larger. We thought about mashing sheep together...but that was kind of weird and grotesque to. So instead we thought of clouds!

This game relates to the theme both in that the main mechanic is to join together clouds to make it rain, and in that to perform the rain dance, you must control the snakedragon, and the "rain spirit" inside, both together, moving with symmetry, trying to achieve harmony to make it rain.

Initially you controlled the two dragons separately, but that was really hard. And it looked really cool when you could kind of move them together symmetrically. So we thought, why not make ​that ​the default way to move? 

This made it much easier to control, but also really fun just to move around and create different patterns. We hope you enjoy soaring above the skies and dancing with the rain spirit. We appreciate you taking the time to play and any feedback you have!

​
HOW DOES IT FIT THEME: You perform a rain dance by controlling two snakedragons whose controls mirror each other. You must learn to control these enjoined dragons to bring rain.
===

* Rotate the clouds for variety
* Make arrow keys also work for single dragon
* Fix camera jump when you go back to solo mode

* Require minumum number of clouds to make rain cloud?
* Figure out why adding tiles in BG makes fps drop? 
* Discard unused items in list of positions
* if player is out of bounds, turn torwads center
* Connect gamepad twin stick

STUFF TO TWEAK:

* If you combine more than 10 clouds it automatically floods?
* Size of rain cloud given number of input clouds?
* How many farms there are?
* How many clouds there are?
* How long the dragon is?
* Rain dance dragon dist radius
* Rain dance cloud radius
* When to fade to black?
	* If there are less than 50 clouds left
	* And you haven't made anything rain in 2 minutes, fade out
	* Or below 30 clouds, fade out

Done:
* Change clouds to smaller margin so they don't get subtracted at spawn
* Use new music
* remove X debug marker
* Make rain sound
* Make sure music cuts out with scene?
* IF IS_PIOUS, then use the version of the BG with pious?
* Fade to black when no more clouds (or less than 30 clouds left within bounds?)
* End screen gives you stats
* Add cloud border
* Add remaining cloud number in the top left

* M to mute
* If rain cloud close enough to farm tile, make it go to next level. 

* Add farm pieces
* Make rain cloud appear when clouds disappear. For a few seconds, then disappears. 
	* Size depends on number of clouds inside?
* If you "rain dance" near a cloud clump, it becomes rain cloud
* Press space again to go back to single mode
* Press space to split
* Improve cloud dragging (basically move along with the dragon)
* Add cloud icons
* Make solo camera
* Make dragon slower 
* Add dragon bodies in 
* Make clouds NOT get pushed if key is not pressed


* Create dragon head, moving automatically, arrow keys to rotate
* Make dragon have multiple pieces
* Make camera follow both and zoom out
* Explore physics joints for dragon pieces?
	OR see: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/snake


* Make dragon fly slower when key not pressed

* Create cloud pieces that are pushed with collision?
	* Add physics body to each cloud
	* Enable collision, see how that feels
	* Turn off collision, just detect it
		When they are colliding, just make the clouds move away
	* No collision at all, just check when clouds are closeby, and move out of the way
