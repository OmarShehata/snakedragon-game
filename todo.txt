* Make dragon turn whiteish when rain dance mode (to communicate that you can't push clouds in this mode)
* Rain animation


	
* Make it possible to reset game

* Look into displays stats in the game?
	https://apidocs.gameanalytics.com/metrics#section/Metrics-API/Integration
	need to contact them to get access...

	Use NG api instead? https://www.newgrounds.io/get-started/#step-4-implement-the-api-into-your-game
	Maybe I can use the scoreboard as a hack? Don't see a way to retrieve events after logging them

* Figure out how buttons work (to make a "skip tutorial" button)
* Add buttons for help or exit
	Help contains the following
	- 1. Move with W or UP. 
	- 2. Turn with arrows or A/D
	- 3. Push clouds onto farms
	- 4. SPACE to summon the rain spirit
	- 5. Dance with rain spirit to make it rain
	- 6. Bring rain to your worshippers (who have a snakedragon idol). Or don't! It's up to you.
	- 7. Game ends when less than 30 clouds remain.  

Done:
* Make it exit when you reach 30 right away
* Make dragons hover when they are frozen
* Plan new tutorial
	- Show 3rd step saying to press space, and dance
	- Final step, say
		- Cool, you made it rain, but not on a farm.
		- You made it rain on the farm!
		- You flooded the farm! Try using less clouds. 
	- Final final step says bring rain to your followers, or don't. 
	- Fade out. 
	- Detect when clouds enter yellow circles (must be 2 or more. Must NOT be already in the circles).
	- Make second step text only appear after dragon is fully elongated
* Make moving clouds only use head
* Add big cloud to where dragon spawns
* Make camera transition smoother (just removed the dual camera)
* Make rain dance wider
* Make it so for dragon dance to work you have to be moving


Examples of good tutorials:

* From: https://norrimo.itch.io/buggish, consider having a little ? icon in the game to remind you what to do? And/or to exit out?
