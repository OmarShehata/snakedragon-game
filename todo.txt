Done:
* Make it possible to reset game
	* Just a "Next" button
	* Next screen just has "Thanks for playing! There are 5 possible endings to this game". "Back to menu" button. 
* Rain animation
* Add new music 
* Add buttons for help
* Add fullscreen button
* Make skip tutorial button work 
* Make dragon turn whiteish when rain dance mode (to communicate that you can't push clouds in this mode)
	* Or just make camera follow both?

* Make clouds stick to farms when you pass through them.
* Look into bug where rain spirit separates
	(I think it was the hovering)
* Look into bug where you can touch cloud but it doesn't move?
* Make clouds stick to farms
* Bug where multiple tutorial steps are on top of each other


* Make it exit when you reach 30 right away
* Make dragons hover when they are frozen
* Plan new tutorial
	- Show 3rd step saying to press space, and dance
	- Final step, say
		- Cool, you made it rain, but not on a farm.
		- You made it rain on the farm!
		- You flooded the farm! Try using less clouds. 
	- Final final step says bring rain to your followers, or don't. 
	- Fade out. 
	- Detect when clouds enter yellow circles (must be 2 or more. Must NOT be already in the circles).
	- Make second step text only appear after dragon is fully elongated
* Make moving clouds only use head
* Add big cloud to where dragon spawns
* Make camera transition smoother (just removed the dual camera)
* Make rain dance wider
* Make it so for dragon dance to work you have to be moving


Examples of good tutorials:

* From: https://norrimo.itch.io/buggish, consider having a little ? icon in the game to remind you what to do? And/or to exit out?
